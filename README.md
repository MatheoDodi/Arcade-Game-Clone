Udacity's Front End Nanodegree

Arcade Game Clone Project (aka Frogger Clone)
===============================

This is a project from Udacity's Nanodegree program "Front-End Web Developer". The project is based on the arcade game Frogger by Konami 

#Play the Game

[Click Here](https://matthewdodi.github.io/Arcade-Game-Clone/)

Or, you could also click on "Clone or Download" on this repository page and download it as ZIP. Extract the folder content and open "index.html" from a brownser for the game to run.

#Game Rules

The goal of the game is to reach the water side while avoiding getting hit by the enemies (bugs). When the player reaches the water side you pass to the next level where the difficult increases making the bugs move faster (this feature will be implemented later). If you get hit you loose and go back to the starting position.

#Control

Use the arrow keys to control the player's moving direction.

That's pretty much it, hope you like it!
